# Rei Audio Condenser 

### Introduction 

The audio condenser allows a individual to quickly take a video file (such as a mkv file) combined with the subtitle file to remove the segments of the original video file that do not contain dialouge. As of right now the condenser makes the assumption that the subtitle files are properly aligned and does not make any attempt to do so when creating the audio outputs.
